# Prisma AIRS Integrations

Welcome to the central documentation repository for all integrations with Palo Alto Networks Prisma AIRS (AI Runtime Security).

## Overview

Prisma AIRS is a comprehensive AI security platform designed to protect the entire AI application lifecycle. It secures AI and traditional applications, agents, models, and datasets against a wide range of threats.

This repository contains step-by-step setup guides for integrating Prisma AIRS with various third-party MLOps, AI Gateway, and automation platforms. These integrations allow you to embed security directly into your AI workflows, enforcing policies and scanning for threats in real-time.

## Key Concepts

* **AI Runtime Security (AIRS):** A platform that provides inline, real-time security for AI applications, protecting against threats like prompt injection, malicious code, and sensitive data leakage.
* **Strata Cloud Manager:** The central management interface for configuring Prisma AIRS, including creating security profiles and generating API keys.
* **Security Profile:** A named configuration within Strata Cloud Manager that defines the specific threat detection rules and policies to be applied during a scan.
* **Guardrail:** A security control or policy implemented within a partner platform (like an AI Gateway) that leverages the Prisma AIRS API to scan and validate requests and responses.
